# _Language Picker_

#### _A quiz that suggests what programming languages to start learning based off of questions provided, June 7th, 2019_

#### By _**Erik Irgens**_

## Description

_The application starts on a landing page in which you can begin a quiz after a brief description. The button begins the quiz, and a question is displayed. Each question will have a variety of multiple choice answers, which are cycles through using Next/Back buttons. Once all questions are answered, a submit button is presented. Once the submit button has been pressed, if statement functions take over and correlate all relevant information before using a function to determine which language(s) is(are) appropriate for the user to pursue in future learning. The questions are hypothetical, and are meant as a proof of concept for assigning values to variables in a ranking system. _
